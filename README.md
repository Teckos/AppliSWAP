# AppliSWAP
Very last version of an app I developped late 2014 and kept updating until mid 2015.
Based on the work I did with the interns on my previous app, I developped that one on my very own.
*Detailed description to be added

I uploaded tbe database with the IMEIs (International Mobile Equipment Identity) masked for obvious confidential reason although these are 7 years old devices which are most likely not being used anymore. 
Bills of delivery registered in the DB (they were generated by the app) shows the app's life spanned from 2014 November the 12th to 2015 24th of July. The table 'r√©paration' has 5370 entries which means there was about as many devices processed during this short period of time.
No need to say the app served his purpose.
